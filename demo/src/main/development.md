development possibilities

- write more crud method, so we can delete, update datas.
- connect the application to a RDMS or non-RDBMS, so the datas will be handled by it.
- develop frontend, so there will be possibility to offer full application to clients.
- extend the models. E.g.: details from the jobs or possibility to upload a cv for the clients.
